This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python involving the handling of a ZeroDivisionError. The `function_with_uncommon_bug` function incorrectly returns 0 instead of raising an exception when the input is 0. This can be difficult to debug because it doesn't immediately crash the program, but it might lead to unexpected results down the line. The solution provided fixes this issue by ensuring the function raises the appropriate exception.
